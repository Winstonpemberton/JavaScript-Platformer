Overview 
this sets the spacing, layout and colors of the game

class - .background
Summery: sets the background color, table layout and border spacing

Tips: its a table so the layout should be fixed and there should be no spacing

class - .background td 
Summery: td is used to get the table's cells, this sets the padding of each cell 

tips: there should be no padding because it would look very weird, though you are using it like a table it really isn't 

class - .lava 
Summery: just set the color of lava 

Tips: the background css method sets the color 

class - .wall 
Summery: sets the color of walls 

class - .actor 
Summery: sets the position of actors 

Tips: the position should be absolute so the game knows where actors are at all times

class - .coin 
Summery: sets the color of coins 

class - .player
Summery: sets the color of the player 

class - .lost .player
Summery: sets a new color of the player if they lose which would only happen if they touch lava

class - .won .player 
Summery: sets a halo above the players head but to be real you could just set it to turn yellow or something

Tips: the box shadow method is used to set a white box above the players head 

class - .game 
Summery: sets up how big the game will display, what is shown, and the position of the display 

Tips: max height and max width are css methods, overflow is a method that can be set to hide anything beyond the specified point and setting the position to relative puts it in the top left corner
