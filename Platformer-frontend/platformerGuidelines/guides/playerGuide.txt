Method - constructor(position, speed)
Summery: this is for placement when drawing and updating

Method - type()
Summery: this method returns the type of the player so when other methods iterate through a list of actors it can call it and know what it is 

Return type: the type should be a string since you only need to see what it is and not actually create it yet 

Tips: it should be a getter method 

Method - create(position)
Summery: this method creates a player object, it's mostly used in the drawing process 

Return type: the return type is going to be a new player object with a given position using Vectors 

Tips: shouldn't be too difficult, if anything it'll be trail and error to see where it spawns 

Method - update(time, state, keys)
Summery: this method is used for determining how the player moves and is effected by gravity. it checks to see which direction the player is holding a key and moves it in that direction, it also needs to know if the place its going to move to is a wall. this method determines both the x axis and the y axis also known as jumping 

Return type: a new player object with and updated position and new VectorPosition with the players x axis speed and y axis speed 

Tips: set up variable to hold the jumpSpeed and gravity, use the prototype method because creating an actual function would waste resources, time and the state of the game is crucial for determining if the player can go where it needs to 

Method- size 
Summery: this just sets the size of the player 

Return type: a new VectorPosition 

Tips: VectorPosition is essentially a position on a grid so the size is going to be determine how many grid spaces a player takes up
