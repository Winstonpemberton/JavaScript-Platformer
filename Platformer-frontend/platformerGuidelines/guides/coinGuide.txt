Overview 
creates a coin and holds all of its necessary class properties and methods. It has five methods and needs a position on creation 

Method - constructor()

Method - type()
Summery: it returns the type of the object, mostly for iterating purposes when drawing

Return type: returns a string coin 


Method - create(position)
Summery: sets the position of the coin

Return type: a new coin object

Method - collide(state)
Summery: checks to see if the player collided with it so it would disappear so the player can win and go to the next level 

Return type: a new state object with the update amount of coins left and a new status 

tips: state is crucial for this to work, this method needs to know how many coins there's and send that to state. you'll need an array to subtract the amount of coins left after every time the player collides with a coin 

Method - update(time)
Summery: this is used to make the coin wobble but this is definitely going to be a stretch goal 

Return type: returns a new coin object with an update position, base position and wobble 

Tips: its a prototype method and Math.sin creates a circle affect 

Method - size()
Summery: it sets the size of every coin 

Return type: a new Vector object 

Tips: mostly going to eyeball it to see if wonk
